## Prerequisites

Git: If you don't have Git installed, visit the official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Node.js: This project requires Node.js. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from nodejs.org.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**
    
    - Open your terminal (or command prompt on Windows).

    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone it into a directory named "projects", you can use: 
    
        `cd path/to/projects`

    - Clone the repository by using the following command:
    
        `git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]`
    
        Replace *[REPOSITORY_URL]* with the actual URL of the GitHub repository. For example, if the repository URL is https://github.com/username/projectname.git , then the command becomes:

        `git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory:

    `cd projectname`

    Replace *projectname* with the name of the directory that was created when you cloned the repository.


3. **Install the Dependencies**

    Before you can run the Next.js app, you need to install its dependencies. In the terminal, make sure you are inside the project directory and run:

    `npm install`

4. **Run the Development Server**

    With all dependencies installed, you can now start the development server:

    `npm run dev`

    Once the command completes, it should indicate that the server is running, usually with a message like:

        ready - started server on http://localhost:3000

5. **Access the App in Your Browser**
    
    Open your preferred web browser and navigate to:

    http://localhost:3000

    You should see the Next.js app running!
